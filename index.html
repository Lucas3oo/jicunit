    <h1>JICUnit</h1>
    <p>JICUnit is a Java testing framework for JEE in-container testing
      based on JUnit. JICUnit is inspired by JUnitEE/JUnitEEv2 and
      Jakarta Cactus, both which are not developed any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short the JUnit tests are packaged in a test WAR and deployed
      to
      the JEE container where they can be executed.
