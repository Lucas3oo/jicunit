JICUnit
=======

JICUnit is a Java testing framework for JEE in-container testing based on [JUnit](http://junit.org). JICUnit is inspired by [JUnitEE](http://www.junitee.org)/[JUnitEEv2](http://junite2.sourceforge.net) and [Jakarta Cactus](https://jakarta.apache.org/cactus/), both which are not developed any more.

In short the JUnit tests are packaged in a test WAR and deployed to the JEE container where they can be executed.
